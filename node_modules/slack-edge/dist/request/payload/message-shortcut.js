// The Message Shortcut payload
// ------------------------------------------
//
// Message shortcuts are shown to users in the context menus of non-ephemeral messages within Slack. If you're using Bolt framework, you can handle this pattern using app.shortcut listners.
//
// Message shortcuts will retain the context of the source message from which they were initiated. This makes them ideal when you have a workflow that relies on that context to work.
// For example, users might quickly generate tasks from a posted message, or send messages to external services. Think about what app invocation points belong in a global context versus which belong in a message context. For example, pretend you're building a task management app. An example of a shortcut that makes sense in a global context would be Create a task, whereas a shortcut that belongs in a message context would be Attach to a task, which could attach the specific message to an existing task.
