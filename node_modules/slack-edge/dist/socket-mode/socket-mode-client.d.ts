/**
 * An experimental Socket Mode client
 *
 * Please note that this is still experimental and it's not recommended to use it for production apps.
 * If you need a reliable Socket Mode client, please use @slack/socket-mode library on Node.js along with slack-edge.
 *
 * @todo Implement proper reconnection logic
 * @todo Add connection monitor like 1st party SDKs do
 * @todo Add Bun support (the runtime does not work well with Socket Mode)
